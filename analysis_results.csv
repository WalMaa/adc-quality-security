S1,"The presence of a sewer system under the building indicates a potential water infiltration risk. The unreinforced walls make the processing center susceptible to water damage, which can lead to health hazards such as mold growth and bacterial contamination.","The processing center is located in the basement with a sewer system running underneath. The walls are not reinforced, increasing the risk of water damage and potential health hazards.",T1,V1,R1
S1,"The processing center is in a basement, which is often a place for water accumulation. The presence of a sewer system running nearby suggests that water can enter the building through the basement walls. The walls being unreinforced make them vulnerable to water penetration, leading to the risk of mold growth and damage to equipment and materials.","The processing center is located in the basement with a sewer system running underneath. The walls are not reinforced, making them susceptible to water damage and potential mold growth.",T1,V1,R1
S2,"The scenario describes a system with multiple layers of security, including physical and biometric measures, which effectively mitigates the threat of unauthorized access.","The system is protected by multiple layers of security, including physical and biometric measures.",T1,V1,R1
