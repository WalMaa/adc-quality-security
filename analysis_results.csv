V1,Generated by AI model.,Communication channels not adequately protected,T1,V1,"For example: During a recent security training exercise at an international airport, two military personnel were involved in a simulated attack. They used text messages to communicate with each other while on the move; however, these messages were intercepted and read by third parties due to the lack of encryption in their communication channels."

V1,Generated by AI model.,Communication channels not adequately protected,T1,V1,"The scenario highlights the importance of securing communication channels for critical operations, particularly involving government or military activities. Without adequate encryption, sensitive information can be intercepted and misused, posing significant risks to national security."

V1,Generated by AI model.,Communication channels not adequately protected,T1,V1,"1. **Critical Nature of Communications**: Military and governmental communications are inherently sensitive. Any unauthorized access can lead to severe consequences, including strategic"
V2,Generated by AI model.,Uncontrolled changes to the operating system,T1,V2,"(OS) or software systems in an organization have caused a security vulnerability. The management team has identified that either they can implement controls over these changes, but they are not capable of monitoring the changes after implementation due to limited resources."
V2,Generated by AI model.,Uncontrolled changes to the operating system,T1,V2,They also recognize that implementing controls over all potential changes is impractical because of organizational complexity and resource constraints.
V2,Generated by AI model.,Uncontrolled changes to the operating system,T1,V2,"Therefore, the management team proposes to focus on a subset of high-impact changes. They plan to manually review each change before it's applied to ensure no security vulnerabilities are introduced."
V2,Generated by AI model.,Uncontrolled changes to the operating system,T1,V2,"To accomplish this, they need to design an effective manual reviewing process with controls (for example, checklist templates) that would help mitigate security risks."
