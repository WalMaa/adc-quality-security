S1,"The processing center's walls being unreinforced increases the risk of structural failure, especially given the proximity to a sewer system which can cause water damage and potential subsidence.",The unreinforced walls around the processing center pose a significant threat due to the underlying sewer system. This could lead to water-related issues such as mold growth or structural instability over time.,RC-01,VULN-001,REMED-001
S1,"The processing center is located in an area with a sewer system running underneath, which could pose a risk if there's any water leak from the processing unit. Additionally, the walls are not reinforced, making them susceptible to damage from such leaks.",A potential water leak from the processing center could cause damage to the building structure and surrounding environment due to the presence of a sewer system nearby.,T-1234,V-5678,R-9012
S2,"The scenario describes a setting where confidential documents are stored in an archive with multiple layers of security measures including armed guards, biometric protection, and a reinforced, burglar-proof room. These measures suggest a high level of protection against unauthorized access and theft.","Confidential documents are securely stored in an archive with enhanced physical security features such as armed guards, multi-level biometric authentication systems, and a highly secure environment resistant to burglary.",THREAT_001,VULN_002,REMED_013
S2,"The scenario describes a setup where confidential documents are stored in an archive with multiple layers of security measures including armed guards, biometric protection, and a reinforced, burglar-proof room. These measures collectively aim to prevent unauthorized access or theft of the documents.","Confidential documents are securely stored in an archive with enhanced physical security features such as armed guards, multi-level biometric authentication systems, and a highly secure room that is resistant to burglary.",THREAT_001,VULN_002,REMED_003
S3,"The connection uses fiber optics which are known to be susceptible to certain types of cyber threats such as physical attacks, electromagnetic interference, and potential vulnerabilities like weak points or installation flaws that could be exploited by attackers.","Fiber optic cables used for data center connections may be vulnerable to physical tampering, electromagnetic interference, and have potential weaknesses in their installation which can be exploited by malicious actors.",T1234,V5678,R9012
S4,"The scenario describes an information system with multiple layers of security measures in place, including the use of optical fiber for communication between the CED and offices, which is further secured by channels protected against unauthorized access. The communication on these channels uses ciphers at the highest classification level compared to the transmitted data, indicating a high priority for confidentiality and protection against eavesdropping.","The system employs advanced physical security (optical fiber) and strong encryption (highest cipher level) to protect sensitive communications between CED and offices, ensuring confidentiality and reducing potential threats from unauthorized access.",T1-001,V2-007,R3-015
S5,"The system's placement on the third floor may not be directly related to its functionality but could pose risks if it's exposed to potential threats such as fire, theft, or unauthorized access. The absence of specific security controls suggests that there might be vulnerabilities in terms of physical access control and data protection.","Placement of a system on the third floor without additional security measures may expose it to risks like unauthorized access, fire hazards, or theft. This could lead to potential breaches or damage if not properly secured.",THREAT-001,VULN-002,REMED-003
S5,"The system's placement on the third floor may not be directly related to its functionality but could pose risks if it's exposed to potential threats such as fire, theft, or unauthorized access. The absence of specific security controls suggests that there might be vulnerabilities in terms of physical access control and data protection measures.","Placement on the third floor without special security controls may leave the system exposed to external threats like fire, theft, or unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches or operational disruptions.",T12345,V67890,R00123
S5,"The system's placement on the third floor may not be inherently dangerous unless there are specific risks associated with that location. However, it could be vulnerable to physical damage from falling objects or unauthorized access by individuals who have access to that area.","The system is installed on the third floor of a building without any special security controls, which means it's exposed to potential risks such as physical damage and unauthorized access.",T1,V2,R3
S6,"The absence of fire protection systems indicates a potential risk of fire spread and damage without proper containment measures. This could lead to significant property loss, injuries, and even fatalities if an emergency occurs.","No fire protection systems are in place on the site, leaving it vulnerable to fire risks.",T123456,V123456,R123456
S6,"The absence of fire protection systems indicates a potential risk of fire spread and damage without proper containment measures. This could lead to significant property loss, injuries, and even fatalities if an emergency occurs.","No fire protection systems are in place on the site, leaving it vulnerable to fire risks.",T123,V456,R789
S6,"The absence of fire protection systems indicates that the site lacks basic safety measures against fire-related incidents. This could leave the site vulnerable to potential fires, which can be dangerous for personnel, property, and the environment.","No fire protection systems are present on the site, leaving it vulnerable to fire risks.",T123456,V123456,R123456
S7,"The installation of a fire protection system including smoke detectors and a temperature control system is essential for assessing potential risks and ensuring safety measures are in place. This setup helps detect early signs of fire, allowing timely actions to mitigate damage and prevent further incidents.","A fire protection system with smoke detector and temperature control system has been installed on the site, aiding in early detection of fires and enhancing overall safety.",T1234,V5678,R9012
S7,"The installation of a fire protection system including smoke detectors and a temperature control system is a critical security measure to prevent and mitigate fire-related risks. This setup helps detect fires early, reduces damage, and allows for timely evacuations or cooling systems activation.",A fire protection system with smoke detector and temperature control system has been installed on the site as part of standard safety measures to enhance fire safety protocols.,T123456,V123456,R123456
