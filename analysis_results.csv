S1,"The presence of a sewer system under the building indicates a potential water infiltration risk. The unreinforced walls make the processing center susceptible to water damage, which can lead to health hazards such as mold growth and bacterial contamination.","The processing center is located in the basement with a sewer system running underneath. The walls are not reinforced, increasing the risk of water damage and potential health hazards.",T1,V1,R1
S2,,"Confidential documents are stored in an archive with multiple layers of security, including armed guards and biometric protection. The room is reinforced and burglar-proof.",123456,789012,345678
S3,"The scenario describes a network connection using fiber optics, which is a common and reliable technology for long-distance communication.","The network connection between the data center and the offices is established using fiber optic cables, ensuring high-speed and reliable data transmission.",T1,V1,R1
S4,The communication is protected by ciphers approved at the highest classification level.,The communication is protected by ciphers approved at the highest classification level.,T1,V1,R1
S5,"The system is installed on the third floor without any special security controls, which could allow unauthorized access.","The system is installed on the third floor of a building without any special security controls, which may allow unauthorized access.",T1,V1,R1
S6,"The absence of fire protection systems poses a significant risk of fire spread and damage, especially in high-rise buildings or large open spaces where fires can quickly escalate.",No fire protection systems are installed on the site.,T1,V2,R3
S7,"The fire protection system with smoke detectors and temperature control is a critical asset that can prevent significant damage in case of fire. However, if not properly maintained, it can become a vulnerability.","A fire protection system with smoke detectors and temperature control is a critical asset that can prevent significant damage in case of fire. However, if not properly maintained, it can become a vulnerability.",T1,V1,R1
S8,Halogon 1301 is a hazardous gas with significant fire risks and health hazards. Its use in fire protection systems poses a direct threat to personnel and the public.,"The system uses Halon 1301 gas, which is a hazardous chemical with a high fire risk and potential health hazard.",T1,V1,R1
S9,"The system requires a password for access, which is a common security measure to protect against unauthorized access.",The system requires a password to access.,T1234,V5678,R9012
S10,"The scenario indicates that there is no restriction on who can access the system. This means that unauthorized users can potentially access sensitive information, leading to potential threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and unauthorized modifications.","No access control measures are in place, allowing any user to access the system.",T1,V1,R1
S11,"The password is shared among multiple users, which increases the risk of unauthorized access if the password is compromised.","Only those who have a password can access the system. The password must meet complexity requirements, is stored in a historical database and must be changed once every 90 days. The password is shared among members of the same office.",T1,V1,R1
S12,"The system uses a password-based authentication mechanism with complexity requirements, which is a common vulnerability. The storage in a historical database and the requirement to change passwords frequently are known practices to mitigate this vulnerability. The use of nominative credentials and forbidding their disclosure aligns with best practices to prevent unauthorized access.","Only those who have a password can access the system. The password must meet complexity requirements, is stored in a historical database and must be changed once every 90 days. The access credentials are nominative and it is forbidden to reveal them to third parties.",T1,V1,R1
